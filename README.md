# fdf
Draws a wireframe map loaded from a file with different projections and animated colors. There's zoom, spin, pan, robust map reading different color palettes and a psychedelic color scheme. Written in C from scratch, only using library calls to open and draw to a window. This was the first graphics branch project in the school so I drilled down on the basics like events and just how to draw the lines correctly with simple math. Also worked on code organization to make it simpler to understand and work with.
